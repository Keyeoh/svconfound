}
\details{
The function \code{get_control_variables} just takes a \code{RGChannelSet}
object as input, accesses the values of its control probes, and returns
them as a numeric matrix.

This is an internal function. Its purpose is to provide the main analysis
functions with more data to test. It is usually useful to test if control
probes are introducing some confounding in the dataset, as it might be
signaling that there are unknown effects in the data.
