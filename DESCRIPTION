Description: This package implements a simple strategy for analyzing confounding
    variation on datasets. The strategy is mostly based on Andrew Teschendorff's
    book chapter 3 in "Computational and Statistical Epigenomics". It provides
    two functions for SVD and SVA analysis of the possible confounding variables
    among the phenotype data and control variables, and implementations of the
    screeplot and plot methods for them.
